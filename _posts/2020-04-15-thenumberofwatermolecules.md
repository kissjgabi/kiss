## Chemical formula of water

To calculate the number of molecules in, you need to know the chemical formula of water. 
There are two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen in each water molecule.
They make up the formula H<sub>2</sub>O.

## Molar mass of water

Determine the molar mass of water. 
Do this by adding up the mass of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms in a mole of water. 
One has to look the atomic mass of hydrogen and oxygen on the periodic table. 
The mass of hydrogen is 1,008 g/mol and the mass of oxygen is 15,99 g/mol.
The mass of a mole of water can be calculated as follows:  

>M<sub>water</sub> = 2 × M<sub>H</sub> + M<sub>O</sub>  
M<sub>water</sub>  = 2 × 1,008 + 15,99  
>><u>&nbsp;M<sub>water</sub>  = 18,015 g&nbsp;</u>  

## The Avogrado's Number

Avogadro's number tells us the number of molecules of water per mole of water:  
>><u>&nbsp;N<sub>A</sub> = 6,022 x 10<sup>23</sup> 1/mol&nbsp;</u>

## Density of water

Use the density of water to determine the mass of water per unit volume. 
The value used in calculations is:  
>><u>&nbsp;1,00 g/ml&nbsp;</u>.  

## Determine the number of molecules in

### a.) 1 mole i.e. 18,015 g = 18,015 ml of water
>><u>&nbsp;n = 6,022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules&nbsp;</u>  

        i.e. - id est

### b.) 1 g = 1 ml = 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of water
>><u>&nbsp;n = 6,022 x 10<sup>23</sup> / 18,015 = 3,343 x 10<sup>22</sup> molecules&nbsp;</u>  

### c.) 1000 g = 1 l = 1 dm<sup>3</sup> of water
>><u>&nbsp;n = 1000 x 3,343<sup>22</sup> = 3,343 x 10<sup>25</sup> molecules&nbsp;</u>  

### c.) 0,001 g = 0,001 ml = 1 mm<sup>3</sup> of water
>><u>&nbsp;n = 0,001 x 3,343<sup>22</sup> = 3,343 x 10<sup>19</sup> molecules&nbsp;</u>  

        and so on...
