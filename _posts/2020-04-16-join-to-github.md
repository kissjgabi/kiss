GitHub Pages are public webpages.
They are hosted and easily published through GitHub.

You can use Github for free.


The quickest way to get up using a pre-made theme. 
You can then modify your gitHub page remotely via the web or locally on your computer.

Once you’ve signed in, you’ll create a new repository to get started.

On the new repository screen, you need to give this repository a special name to generate your website.
