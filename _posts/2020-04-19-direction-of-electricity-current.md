## Electric current

Electric current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in an electric circuit. Most electric charge is carried by the electrons and protons within an atom.  
The speed of an electron in a wire ia few million meters per second, but it doesn't travel straight down the wire. It bounces around nearly at random and only makes progress at a few millimeters per second. This is called the electron's drift velocity.  
However, the transmission speed of the signal, when electrons start being pushed out the other end of the wire after we flip the switch, is nearly the speed of light.  
Electrons flow in the circuit from the "Gnd" (-) contact of the power supply and leave away the circuit at the ( +) contact.

By definition, electrical current is the flow of positive charge. The flow of electrical current is not the flow of electrons. That means if electrons flowing one way, then electrical current is flowing the other way. It's convention.
